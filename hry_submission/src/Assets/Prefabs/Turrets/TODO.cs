public class TODO : MonoBehaviour {

	// - Make sound hit effects not to be bound to the particles AudioSource, get rid of the sound warning
	// - bullet animation - do i really have to make scripting for that? think it could be done just by adding 
    //animator dircetly to that thing, and just leave the controller Entry > Animation
}
